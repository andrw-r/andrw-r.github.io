<p>Hello! I'm Andrew, a student developer @ Memorial University of Newfoundland, based in St. John's, pursuing a B.Sci joint degree in Computer-Science & Economics.</p>
<p>I've been working in the healthcare industry as a technician for a nursing assessment organization since early 2023.</p>
<p>Currently my main interests are discrete mathematics, decreasing water footprints, as well as machine learning. </p>
<p>When I'm not studying, I enjoy producing electronic music & practicing the trumpet; I've been playing trumpet for over 12 years, currently as a member of the MUN Jazz Orchestra & MUN Wind Ensemble.</p>
<p>I'm known for my dedication to the task at hand. I am not afraid to get things wrong, as it often leads to the greatest opportunity for rapid learning.</p>
